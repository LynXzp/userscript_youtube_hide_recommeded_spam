# This is userscript for hiding annoying youtube recomendation
Ussualy half of suggested videos very annoing.
Some of the recomendation basing on your watched video, but with accent on paid videos.
Other is new virus video in "Yellow sensation" style.
Hide it all and watch only releated to current video recommendations.
